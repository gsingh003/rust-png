# Introduction

My goal for this project was to do a systems programming challenge. I decided to implement the PNG file format from scratch as I am a fan of projects
that yield visual results. Much of my knowledge about the file format was cobbled together from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG
This project strengthened both my technical knowledge in how underlying file formats work and how low-level systems are implemented from the ground up.
